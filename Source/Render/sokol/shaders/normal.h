    Shader descriptor structs:

        sg_shader program = sg_make_shader(normal_program_shader_desc(sg_query_backend()));

    Vertex attribute locations for vertex shader 'vs':

        sg_pipeline pip = sg_make_pipeline(&(sg_pipeline_desc){

    Image bind slots, use as index in sg_bindings.vs_images[] or .fs_images[]
